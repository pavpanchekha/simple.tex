Simple TeX Styles
=================

This is a collection of simple TeX styles. Right now it contains
three:

 + `simple.cls` is a very minimal page style for drafts and informal
   writings. It adds the `\draft{n}` command for numbering version of
   the document.
 + `pset.cls` is a page style for problem sets. It adds the
   `\class{name}` and `\collaborators{names}` commands to list the
   class name and collaborators on a problem set. It also defines the
   `\todo` command to mark not-yet-completed sections and `\ans` to
   box answers. For plots it provides `\coordsys`, `\smallcoordsys`,
   and `\plotfq`, the first two of which make a large and small set of
   zero-centered axes, and the last of which provides axes for the
   first quadrant.
 + `w755-essay.sty` sets up a very specific page and title layout, as
   required by a writing class I once took.
